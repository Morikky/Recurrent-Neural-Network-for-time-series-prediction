The data used here is from the Walmart dataset that is publicly availble from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/walmart-dataset).
It includes time series for multiple variables (e.g., sales, fuel price, unemployment) in weekly intervals and consist of 143 data points (between 05/02/2010 and 26/10/2012).
The sales variable is predicted here. Prediction length is one data point (the last data point) using the 142 points before it.
The data is from 45 different stores. 36 of them are used to train the model and 9 to validate the model.
